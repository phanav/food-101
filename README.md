## Food 101 challenge summary

Food-101 is a challenging vision problem, but everyone can relate to it. Recent SoTA is ~80% top-1, 90% top-5. These approaches rely on lots of TTA, large networks and even novel architectures.

Train a decent model >85% accuracy for top-1 for the test set, using a ResNet50 or smaller network with a reasonable set of augmentations.
